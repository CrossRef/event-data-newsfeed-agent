This is the first championship where protective headgear has been banned. This is in line with a global ban on protective headgear because it doesn’t protect heads (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2293803/Headgear-boxers-banned-bid-REDUCE-head-injuries.html).

<title>21 sick with Salmonella: Australia still has an egg problem, Melbourne fairytale edition</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You’ve got to be fucking kidding.</p> 
<p><a href="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/salm.egg_.food_.republic.jpg"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/salm.egg_.food_.republic-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"></a>Another day, another outbreak of Salmonella traced to some Master-Chef-inspired raw egg food porn.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/bad-eggs-blamed-for-salmonella-outbreak-at-food-republic-restaurant-in-blackburn/news-story/7483ea31a64d41a8c003d68bc6f96ff4">Paddy Naughtin of the Whitehorse Leader</a> writes tha<em>t a bad batch of eggs is being blamed for 21 people being struck down by a Salmonella outbreak believed to have been picked up at a Blackburn restaurant.</em></p> 
<p><em>The Department of Health and Human Services and Whitehorse Council are still investigating the cause of the outbreak which affected at least 21 people who ate at the Food Republic on Blackburn Rd on March 18.</em></p> 
<p><em>Food Republic co-owner Vanessa Lekkas said she was “genuinely distraught” for those who had been affected and was “humbled by their understanding” .</em></p> 
<p><em>“In almost 30 years of working in the industry we’ve never seen this happen,” Ms Lekkas said.</em></p> 
<p><em>“We get hundreds of boxes delivered each week, and it looks like one of those contained a bad batch of eggs.</em></p> 
<p><em>“We’ve been fully transparent with the council and health authorities, and they’ve seen our food handling processes are up to scratch.</em></p> 
<p><em><a href="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/masterchef.raw_.egg_.jpg"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/masterchef.raw_.egg_-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300"></a>“We’ve been told the investigation is now looking at the farms where the eggs came from,” Ms Lekkas said.</em></p> 
<p><em>Ms Lekkas said the Food Republic would no longer be serving food made with raw egg products.</em></p> 
<p>Why the fuck didn’t they stop years ago?</p> 
<p>There’s been plenty of outbreaks, plenty of publicity, but, humans being humans, they think it won’t happen to them.</p> 
<p>I get that.</p> 
<p>So in the interest of public health, Australians, stop serving raw egg dishes.</p> 
<p>And food porn chefs who are food safety idiots, fuck off.</p> 
<p>Your wellness guidelines are making people sick.</p> 
<p>Health-types, up your game.</p>

<title>Show me the data: butter at room temperature edition</title>
<link>http://barfblog.com/2017/04/show-me-the-data-butter-at-room-temperature-edition/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I like butter on my bagels. So does Jan Polanik. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/business/dunkin-donuts-butter-lawsuit.html?_r=0">According to the New York Times</a>, he filed a pair of class-action lawsuits after paying a quarter for butter every time he ordered bagels over a four year period, but was given margarine without being told.</p> 
<p>Dunkin’ Donuts franchise owners settled the suits, but not until after using food safety as a defense.</p> 
<p><em>In 2013, a Dunkin’ Donuts spokeswoman, Lindsay Harrington, offered an explanation for why a vegetable spread might be used.<a href="http://barfblog.com/2017/04/show-me-the-data-butter-at-room-temperature-edition/he_butter_s4x3_lead/"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HE_butter_s4x3_lead-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></em></p> 
<p><em>“For food safety reasons, we do not allow butter to be stored at room temperature, which is the temperature necessary for butter to be easily spread onto a bagel or pastry,” she told The Boston Globe. The recommended procedure in the store, she said, was for individual whipped butter packets to be served on the side of a bagel or pastry, but not applied. “The vegetable spread is generally used if the employee applies the topping,” she said.</em></p> 
<p>I’m not sure what the food safety reasons are since the salted version (over 1.5%) of oil-in-water emulsion doesn’t support the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lks9dALNzZAC&amp;pg=PA525&amp;lpg=PA525&amp;dq=growth+of+pathogens+in+butter+ambient&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OL3dFbs0Tc&amp;sig=bQ4gcNQcPlmek7C5HNKhS6n_7jU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX6q3tmozTAhVKs1QKHUp5AoU4ChDoAQgnMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=growth%20of%20pathogens%20in%20butter%20ambient&amp;f=false">growth of foodborne pathogens </a>– <a href="http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(72)85685-6/abstract">or staph toxin </a>formation -and remains <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/refridg_food.html">safe at room temperature when the power goes out</a>.  Stuff will persist,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11759767"> including Listeria,</a> but temperature control isn’t a factor.

<title>Blame ‘bad souvlaki’ GPA data to catch Sydney taxi drivers using laneway as a toilet</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Who says the space program hasn’t led to great inventions: Tang, Teflon, and GPS to track down taxi drivers in a public poo pandemic that’s leaving a group of business owners flushed with anger.</p> 
<p><em><a href="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/No-Poop1.jpg"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/No-Poop1.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="208"></a><a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/gps-data-will-be-used-to-catch-taxi-drivers-using-an-ashfield-laneway-as-a-toilet/news-story/67baf7390d9e24f8d104fab9d1142773">Shop owners on Hercules St, Ashfield in Sydney’s inner-west </a>say discovering human feces in the laneway behind their businesses has become “a daily occurrence” along with the nauseating task of <a href="http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/gps-data-will-be-used-to-catch-taxi-drivers-using-a-laneway-in-sydneys-innerwest-as-a-toilet/news-story/07e4e4fced45c25b7788518d36d54f7d?utm_content=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=EditorialSF&amp;utm_source=News.com.au&amp;utm_medium=Facebook">cleaning-up the offerings</a>.</em></p> 
<p><em>The situation has become so bad real estate agent Tim Simpson is considering relocating the business he’s run in the suburb for 40 years.</em></p> 
<p><em>He said the final straw was catching a taxi driver “in the act” last weekend.</em></p> 
<p><em>“I understand drivers are expected to work 24/7 but surely there’s better options than this,” he said.</em></p> 
<p><em>“We’re the ones who are having to clean it up. It’s like living in the Third World.”</em></p> 
<p><em>National taxi firm 13 CABS is investigating the claims by matching complaints against data from GPS devices fitted in taxis.</em></p> 
<p><em>Head of client services Simon Purssey said he was “shocked and horrified” to hear the reports.</em></p> 
<p><em>“I understand ‘when a man’s gotta go, a man’s gotta go’ but if you’ve eaten a bad souvlaki and all of a sudden have to pull over you don’t do it in someone’s property,” he said.</em></p> 
<p>And I thought Australia had great access to public shit depositories, compared to the rest of the world.<br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkJYy9byRmg?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe><br><em> </em></p>]]></description>

<title>Snapshot: Researchers Showcase Wound Healing Patch on Capitol Hill</title>
<link>https://newsblog.drexel.edu/2017/04/04/snapshot-researchers-showcase-wound-healing-patch-on-capitol-hill/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://drexelnewsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/weingartenghalili-washington-dc.jpg?w=980" alt="Weingarten:Ghalili-Washington DC"><em>Rose Ann DiMaria-Ghalili, PhD, and Michael S. Weingarten, MD, at the Medical Imaging Technology Showcase. </em><p>For millions of Americans suffering from chronic wounds, a wearable patch — powered by inaudible sound waves — could offer a life-changing solution.</p> 
<p>That’s the story Drexel University researchers told legislators, scientists and industry partners on Capitol Hill during the eighth annual <a href="https://www.acadrad.org/2017-medical-imaging-technology-showcase/">Medical Imaging Technology Showcase</a> last week.</p> 
<p>They were invited to the nation’s capital to exhibit the powers of a small, lightweight technology that uses ultrasound to speed the healing process.</p> 
<p>The educational event brings together scientists, industry partners and patient groups to “tell their story about how the investment in biomedical imaging research impacts the quality of life for every American citizen,” according to the <a href="http://www.imagingcoalition.org/">Coalition for Imaging and Bioengineering Research (CIBR)</a>. The coalition’s goal is to provide access to imaging technologies so audiences are able to learn firsthand about their impact on patient care.</p> 
<p>Representing Drexel at the showcase were <a href="http://drexel.edu/medicine/Faculty/Profiles/Michael-Weingarten/"><strong>Michael S. Weingarten, MD,</strong></a> medical director of Drexel’s Comprehensive Wound Healing Program, and <a href="http://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/DiMaria-GhaliliRose/"><strong>Rose Ann DiMaria-Ghalili, PhD,</strong></a> an associate professor in the College of Nursing and Health Professions.</p> 
<p>Drexel’s wound healing research team received a $3 million National Institutes of Health award last fall, enabling a study of the therapy on 120 patients over the next five years. Led by <a href="http://drexel.edu/biomed/faculty/core/LewinPeter/"><strong>Peter Lewin, PhD,</strong></a> the Richard B. Beard Distinguished University Professor at Drexel, the project is a collaboration between the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, the College of Medicine and the College of Nursing and Health Professions.</p> 
<p>The innovative new technology — and its potential impact on one local patient — was also featured in a recent <em>WTXF-TV (FOX-29)</em> news segment. <a href="http://www.fox29.com/news/229993065-video">Watch the full video here.</a></p>

<title>Chinese Police Arrest Caretaker in Kindergarten Poisoning Scheme</title>
<link>http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2017/04/chinese-police-arrest-caretaker-in-kindergarten-poisoning-scheme.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>On the afternoon of March 15, ten children at the Hongri Kindergarden in Dongguan, China reported feeling dizzy after coming home from school.  Some even fainted.   Frantic parents called police and had their children treated at the Huangjiang Hospital for treatment.  Though they were all later discharged from hospital, police investigated surveillance footage taken at the school and discovered that a school caretaker had added an unknown substance into the food later eaten by the children.</p>
 
<p>The suspect, who was only identified as Yang, was questioned and police found a bottle of clozapine in her home.  Clozapine is a powerful antipsychotic medication normally prescribed to patients suffering from schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis.   Possible side effects include fainting, vertigo, vomiting, nausea, and heart palpitations.  Yang, who had been employed at the school as a caretaker, was also in charge of serving meals to students and had reportedly slipped her own medication into their food. </p>
 
<p>According to police, Yang had poisoned the students out of revenge since she had been refused a pay raise.   News of the incident has sparked outrage across China.  On Weibo, China’s primary microblogging site, numerous bloggers expressed anger over anyone harming children for the sake of revenge and called for Yang’s prosecution.</p>
 
<p>Police are still investigating.</p>

<title>Heston still don’t know food safety, and Aust. viewers thought he was on acid</title>
<link>http://barfblog.com/2017/04/heston-still-dont-know-food-safety-and-aust-viewers-thought-he-was-on-acid/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><em>In late February 2009, complaints from customers who suffered vomiting, diarrhea and flu-like symptoms began pouring celebrity chef <a href="http://barfblog.com/2014/12/heston-dont-know-food-safety/">Heston Blumenthal’s UK restaurant, the Fat Duck</a>.</em></p> 
<p><em><a href="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heston.aust_.tv_.apr_..17.jpg"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heston.aust_.tv_.apr_..17-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"></a></em></p> 
<p><em><a href="http://barfblog.com/2011/12/529-sickened-final-epi-report-into-norovirus-in-oysters-at-the-fat-duck-wont-please-heston/">A report by the UK Health Protection Agency</a> concluded that 529 patrons paying a ridiculous amount of money for food-porn styled dishes were sickened with Norovirus – this at a restaurant that only seats 40 patrons per night — introduced through contaminated shellfish, including oysters that were served raw and razor clams that may not have been appropriately handled or cooked.</em></p> 
<p><em>Investigators identified several weaknesses in procedures at the restaurant that may have contributed to ongoing transmission including: delayed response to the incident, the use of inappropriate environmental cleaning products, and staff working when ill. Up to 16 of the restaurant’s food handlers were reportedly working with Norovirus symptoms before it was voluntarily closed</em></p> 
<p>Last night, Heston appeared on Australian current affairs program, The Project, and left hosts and viewers scratching their heads.</p> 
<p><em><a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/heston-blumenthals-bizarre-rant-stuns-the-project/news-story/46b2db78b2eca644de129753ee9e6661?utm_content=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=EditorialSF&amp;utm_source=News.com.au&amp;utm_medium=Twitter">Appearing on the show to promote the announcement of the world’s 50 best restaurants</a>, Blumenthal was asked a simple question by Waleed Aly but gave the world’s most confusing answer, with some viewers joking he might have been on “acid.”</em></p> 
<p><em>“What is it that makes a great restaurant?” Aly asked.</em></p> 
<p><em>“This might seem a little tangential,” Blumenthal replied, which turned out to be the understatement of the year.</em></p> 
<p><em>“Human beings became the most powerful species on the planet because through being able to imagine things that don’t exist we created shared beliefs. So all the things that happened after humans: religion, money, language, cultures, social media, fairy tales, they are very human being.</em></p> 
<p><em>“The reason that happened was the brain trebled in size for lots of reasons but primarily through eating cooked food. It broke the food down and our gut changed and this [touches head] is on top of our body to protect, because this [touches neck] is where the next generation are prepared for life.”</em></p> 
<p><em>Blumenthal’s answer was met with blank stares from The Project panelists, but the celebrity chef pushed on.</em></p> 
<p><em>“And so the thing, we should be called omnivores or herbivores, we’re coctivores … we are interdependent beings,” he said.</em></p> 
<p><em>“We’ve been able to work collectively in numbers larger than any other creature and our efficiency in group learning has become quicker, quicker, quicker, quicker. We don’t have to climb a mountain to get water every day, we don’t have to kill an animal to the death to feed our children.”</em></p> 
<p><em>The Project’s resident smarty pants, Waleed Aly, interjected and said, “That explains why we like restaurants, but how do we tell the good ones from the bad ones?”</em></p> 
<p><em>And Blumenthal was off again.</em><br><em> “We have two universes,” he said.</em></p> 
<p><em>“We have our internal universe, our human being and we have our human doing. We have our feelings and our emotions and then we have getting on in life … The problem that’s happening is we are confusing the two things. We are thinking that our happiness is going to be developed by a numerical system … thank god we have because that’s what’s got us to where we’ve got to.</em></p> 
<p><em>(Hang in there, it’s almost over)</em></p> 
<p><em>“There’s a palliative care nurse that wrote a piece in The Guardian last year, the most common things, regrets people had while they were passing away and it was they wished they lived a life true to themselves,” Blumenthal said.</em></p> 
<p><em>“If every human being had an ambition not to have that feeling, and that’s because our new brain that came from eating cooked food … starts to fade and then our raw emotion comes through and we realise, actually, this is about emotion. Food is about emotion.”</em></p> 
<p>Food is also about sustenance, enjoyment, socializing, and not making one barf.</p> 
<p>Heston is a master of both food and words to make one barf.<br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSrLJ_ZX-eQ?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>]]></description>

<title>Fall fairytale: Lawsuit filed after crypto-in-apple-cider sickened more than 100 in 2015</title>
<link>http://barfblog.com/2017/04/fall-fairytale-lawsuit-filed-after-crypto-in-apple-cider-sickened-more-than-100-in-2015/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In Oct. 2015, <a href="http://barfblog.com/2015/11/30-now-sick-cider-at-illinois-fair/">fall festival revellers flocked to the Pike Country Color Drive in Pike County, Illinois</a>, and a bunch of them were soon barfing.</p> 
<p><a href="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/color-drive-logo2014s.gif"><img src="http://barfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/color-drive-logo2014s.gif" alt="" width="200" height="202"></a>Unpasteurized apple cider – a staple of the northern U.S. and Canadian fall festival circuit was blamed for causing more than 100 people to fall ill with cryptosporidiosis.</p> 
<p><a href="http://myjournalcourier.com/news/107779/tainted-cider-draws-legal-action">Nick Draper of My Journal Courier</a> reports<em> a lawsuit has now been files against several groups, including the Pike County Chamber of Commerce and the Barry Business Association.</em></p> 
<p><em>Melissa Kinman of Quincy filed the civil action against Steven and Linda Yoder of Yoder Brothers Dairy Farm, the Pike County Chamber of Commerce and the Barry Business Association. In it, she contends the Yoders were selling and offering free samples of unpasteurized cider that was tainted with Cryptosporidium.</em></p> 
<p><em>The outbreak sickened people ranging in age from less than 1 year old to 89 years old.</em></p> 
<p><em>Health workers from Pike and Adams counties, the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began investigating reports of profuse or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and vomiting. Tests done in December 2015 by the CDC confirmed there was cider contaminated with Cryptosporidium.</em></p> 
<p><em>Cider was not sold at last year’s drive after officials decided to pull the product.</em></p> 
<p>A list of cider and juice-related outbreaks — 84 outbreaks leading to over 3,500 illnesses going back to 1924 – is available here.</p>

<title>Single largest award in whistleblower case investigated by OSHA: a breath of fresh air</title>
<link>http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2017/04/03/single-largest-award-in-whistleblower-case-investigated-by-osha-a-breath-of-fresh-air/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=33807">news release issued today</a> by OSHA, the agency announced an award of $5.4 million for a former Wells Fargo manager who was terminated after alerting superiors to potential fraud. The individual was dismissed from his job in 2010. He filed his complaint with OSHA in 2011 — justice is not often swift.</p> 
<p>The case was handled out of OSHA’s regional office in San Francisco. I spoke to the top official in that office, Barbara Goto, who confirmed the award is the “single largest individual award” in OSHA history for a whistleblower case. The anti-retaliation protections for this individual are <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha-factsheet-sox-act.pdf">provided under</a> the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Specifically, an employer:</p> 
<blockquote><p>“…may not discharge or in any manner retaliate against an employee because he or she filed, caused to be filed, participated in or assisted in a proceeding relating to alleged mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud, violation(s) of SEC rules and regulations, or violation(s) of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.”</p></blockquote> 
<p>The $5.4 million award covers back pay, compensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees. Based on my recollection of news releases announcing other successful whistleblower cases investigated by OSHA, the awards are usually in the $200-500K range. The $5.4 dollar amount in this case is substantial for a couple of reasons. First, the individual was earning an above average salary and bonuses. Second, since 2010 he was unable to find comparable work following his illegal termination. That adds up to a substantial amount of back pay.  OSHA also ordered that the individual be immediately reinstated by Wells Fargo.</p> 
<p>You may recall that Wells Fargo was <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/">investigated by</a> the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for setting unrealistic sales targets for employees. The pressure led some employees to meet their bank’s fee-generating goals by illegally opening several million bank and credit card accounts without their customers’ knowledge. The CFPB ultimately fined Wells Fargo $100 million; other agencies assessed an additional $85 million in penalties.  The whistleblower subject to this OSHA investigation was likely reporting these shams when he was terminated from his job.</p> 
<p>My inquiry to OSHA’s regional office in San Francisco was a breath of fresh air. There has been much disturbing news from Washington, DC, such as President Trump’s proposals to cut agency budgets and dismantle environmental and other public protections. It was terrific to speak to someone on the front lines of worker protections. They have a job to do and they are doing it.</p>

But is there an underlying consensus on elements of future health care legislation that could make a future bill palatable to a broad coalition in Congress?</p> 
<p>According to <a href="http://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Robert%20Field/"><strong>Robert Field, PhD, JD,</strong></a> professor in Drexel’s Dornsife School of Public Health and the Kline School of Law, a lot of fundamental disagreement remains.</p> 
<p>“Republican efforts to revive the AHCA from the dead will encounter pushback from Democrats and moderate Republicans who want to maintain coverage for as many people as possible,” Field said. “GOP leaders are caught between a rock and a hard place. To please the conservative wing of the party, they will have to cut coverage even more, which will make the bill less palatable to moderates.”</p> 
<p>But outside of the Republican conservative wing, there actually is consensus among many in Congress on several key points. The main one is to leave the Medicaid expansion alone.</p> 
<p>“Democrats and moderate Republicans want to keep the Medicaid expansion in essentially its current form,” Field said.</p> 
<p>That point was hammered home last week when the senate of Kansas, a long-held Republican state, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/kansas-republican-states-expand-medicaid-obamacare/521124/">sent a bill authorizing the expansion of Medicaid</a> in the state for up to 150,000 people to its governor, although he subsequently vetoed it.</p> 
<p>Medicaid expansion is not the only potential point of agreement between Democrats and moderate Republicans, Field thinks.</p> 
<p>“Both would like to see a well-functioning market for individual insurance with subsidies for those most in need,” he said. “And both would like to focus on the needs of older Americans who are not yet old enough for Medicare.”</p> 
<p>Achieving all of that could be done within the current framework of the Affordable Care Act.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think conservatives would sign on to any of these goals, but there seem to be enough Democrats and moderate Republicans to push for workable compromises that build on the current ACA while smoothing out its bumps,” Field said.</p> 
<p>“But,” he added, “That can only occur only if they have the chance to work together in the current highly partisan environment.”</p>

<title>Playing politics with women’s health</title>
<link>http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2017/04/03/playing-politics-with-womens-health/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In the 18 days between House Republicans’ introduction of the American Health Care Act and its withdrawal, women’s health was in the spotlight. With House Speaker Paul Ryan now stating that he’s <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/28/15098740/gop-ahca-paul-ryan-comeback">going to try again</a> on legislation to “replace” the Affordable Care Act, it’s worth looking at some of the ways the ACA has benefited women – and how actions from Congress and the Trump administration could affect women’s insurance coverage and access to care.</p> 
<p><strong>Women gained coverage under the ACA</strong></p> 
<p>The ACA’s biggest achievement was reducing the percentage of the population without health insurance. It did this by allowing states to expand Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, and by creating state-based marketplaces where individuals could buy plans — which are subsidized if their incomes are under 400% of the federal poverty level. The <a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/ten-ways-that-repealing-and-replacing-the-affordable-care-act-could-affect-women/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> looked at insurance data from 2013, just before the ACA took full effect, and 2015. In those two years, the uninsured rate among women ages 19 to 64 dropped from 17% to 11%.</p> 
<p>Because <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2012/06/28/supreme-court-decision-is-great-for-public-health-but-fate-of-16-million-poorest-uninsured-is-still-unclear/">the Supreme Court ruled that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion should be voluntary instead of required</a>, its benefits have been unevenly distributed. At the beginning of 2017, <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/slide/current-status-of-the-medicaid-expansion-decision/">31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/medicaid-kansas-brownback-override-legislature.html?_r=0">proponents in other states are working to join the list</a>. Due to their greater risk of living in poverty and greater likelihood of being in one of the program’s eligibility categories (pregnancy, parent of a dependent child, over age 65, or living with a disability), <a href="http://www.whijournal.com/article/S1049-3867(15)00133-4/fulltext">women have historically accounted for the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries</a>, and that has remained the case in the ACA era. Now, though, women in expansion states with incomes up to 138% FPL don’t have to worry about losing coverage 60 days after delivering a baby or when a child celebrates a milestone birthday.</p> 
<p>In the individual market for private insurance, all consumers with records of health problems or older ages have benefited from provisions that a) prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions and b) specify that premiums for older enrollees can be a maximum of three times the cost of those for younger enrollees. Women have enjoyed a particular benefit, though, because prior to the ACA many insurers charged women more for health insurance – a practice known as gender rating. Prior to the ACA, <a href="http://nwlc.org/resources/still-nowhere-turn-insurance-companies-treat-women-pre-existing-condition/">the National Women’s Law Center found that 95% of the best-selling plans in state capitals’ individual insurance markets practiced gender rating</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Quality of coverage: what plans must and can’t include<br></strong></p> 
<p>The ACA addressed another inequity in health coverage by requiring that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits. Many of these, including prescription drugs and mental-health services, benefit women and men alike.  (See <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2017/03/25/the-aca-is-safe-for-now-but-its-still-very-much-in-danger/">Kim Krisberg’s post on essential health benefits</a> for more details.) However, the inclusion of maternity care on the list of essential benefits became the subject of debate during the consideration of both the ACA and the AHCA. Back in 2009, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/01/business/la-fi-mh-pregnancy-20131101">columnist Michael Hiltzik noted in the Los Angeles Times</a> that only 12% of policies in the individual market offered maternity coverage. He gave three reasons why all insurance policies should cover maternity care: Males are involved in pregnancy, too; society has a strong interest in healthy mothers and babies; and universal coverage is the only way to make maternity coverage affordable. Indeed, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/upshot/late-gop-proposal-could-mean-plans-that-cover-aromatherapy-but-not-chemotherapy.html">The New York Times’ Margot Sanger-Katz explains</a>, coverage for many expensive health conditions – from schizophrenia to rheumatoid arthritis – is only affordable and sustainable when all insurers must cover services for a broad range of health needs.</p> 
<p>The ACA lists the categories of essential health benefits, and leaves HHS with the task of defining them in detail. Under the Obama administration, HHS gave the states flexibility to define these benefits. If the Trump administration wanted to lower standards for insurance plans, though, they could write skimpy standards for the benefits, which would supersede existing state requirements for more-comprehensive coverage.</p> 
<p>Separate from the essential health benefits list is the ACA’s requirement for insurers to cover <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/preventive-services-covered-by-private-health-plans/">preventive services</a> without consumer cost-sharing. All adults with private insurance are entitled to receive routine immunizations and evidence-based screenings and counseling (e.g., colonoscopies in adults age 50 and older) without being charged co-payments, co-insurance, or payment towards deductibles. In addition, insurers must cover certain preventive services for women without cost-sharing. For all these categories of preventive services, the law specifies that coverage is based on recommendations from an expert group: for immunizations, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; for screenings and counseling, the US Preventive Services Task Force; and for women’s services, the Health Resources and Services Administration.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/">HRSA’s current list of preventive services for women</a> (<a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/preventive-services-for-women-covered-by-private-health-plans-under-the-affordable-care-act/">updated in December 2016</a>) includes screening for breast and cervical cancer, well-woman visits, screening and counseling for alcohol misuse and for interpersonal and domestic violence, and all FDA-approved methods of contraception. Additional legislation would be required to repeal the ACA provision requiring insurers to cover HRSA-specified services for women, but the Trump administration has the ability to change HRSA’s list. Given that HRSA is part of the Department of Health and Human Services and that <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/house-republican-leader-price-theres-not-one-woman-who-doesn-t-have-access-to-birth-control-5a13b090799c">as a member of Congress Price expressed skepticism that any woman finds birth control unaffordable</a>, it’s not hard to imagine a new list of preventive services from HRSA that contains far fewer items.</p> 
<p>In contrast to Tom Price’s views on contraception’s affordability, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/342699692/PerryUndem-Gender-and-Birth-Control-Access-Report">PerryUndem just conducted a national survey</a> and found 33% of women voters 18-44 said they couldn’t afford to pay more than $10 for birth control if they had to buy it on the day of the survey, and 14% couldn’t afford to pay any amount.</p> 
<p>The House GOP bill also limited insurers’ ability to cover one particular kind of healthcare: abortions. The <a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/ten-ways-that-repealing-and-replacing-the-affordable-care-act-could-affect-women/">AHCA</a> would have banned abortion coverage in plans sold through state marketplaces; prohibited using federal tax credits to buy non-marketplace plans that cover abortion; prevented small employers from receiving tax credits if their plans cover abortions in cases other than rape, incest, or a pregnancy threatening the woman’s life; and use of tax credits by those who’ve recently left a job to pay for policies available under COBRA if those policies cover abortion. These provisions would likely lead to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2017/02/17/the_republican_plan_to_replace_obamacare_includes_a_giant_assault_on_abortion.html">most insurers eliminating abortion coverage from their plans</a> — with the end result that only women who could afford to pay out-of-pocket for abortions would have access to this form of healthcare.</p> 
<p><strong>Cutting off payments to important providers<br></strong></p> 
<p>Another appalling element of the House Republicans’ bill was that it would have prohibited federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. This isn’t about federal dollars paying for abortions, because the Hyde Amendment already prohibits federal funds paying for abortions (except in cases of rape, incest, or a pregnancy threatening the woman’s life). What it would mean is that federal Medicaid would pay all providers for the services they render, except for one – and that one happens to primarily serve women, and provide sexual and reproductive health services to thousands of low-income women who live in areas with few other sources of this kind of care. Cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood would imperil many low-income women’s access to the most effective forms of contraception, as well as STI testing and cancer screenings. In “<a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/ten-ways-that-repealing-and-replacing-the-affordable-care-act-could-affect-women/">Ten Ways That Repealing and Replacing the Affordable Care Act Could Affect Women</a>,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Usha Ranji and colleagues write:</p> 
<blockquote><p>Many low–income women obtain reproductive care at safety-net clinics that receive public funds to pay for the care they provide. The network includes a range of clinics that provide a broad range of primary care services, such as community health centers (CHCs) and health departments as well as specialized clinics that focus on providing family planning services. The largest organization of specialized family planning clinics is Planned Parenthood, which receives federal support through reimbursement for care delivered to women and men on Medicaid, as well as grant funds from the federal Title X family planning program. Despite comprising only 10% of the safety-net clinic that provided subsidized family planning services in 2010, Planned Parenthood clinics served 36% of women (2.4 million women) seeking contraceptive care at these centers.</p></blockquote> 
<p>Many of Planned Parenthood’s more than two million clients go to Planned Parenthood because it’s their preferred source of care. As the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2017/01/understanding-planned-parenthoods-critical-role-nations-family-planning-safety-net">Guttmacher Institute’s Kinsey Hasstedt reports</a>, Planned Parenthood health centers are more likely to offer extended evening and weekend hours and provide the full range of contraceptive options on-site when compared to non-Planned Parenthood federally qualified health centers (also called FQHCs, or community health centers) and health departments – other common sources of care for women whose care is covered by Medicaid or the Title X program. And these other sources of care are unlikely to be able to fill the hole that would be left if Planned Parenthood health centers had to close or reduce their services under a loss of federal funding. Hasstedt writes:</p> 
<blockquote><p>In 332 of the 491 counties that Planned Parenthood health centers served in 2010, Planned Parenthood served at least half of the women obtaining publicly supported contraceptive services from a safety-net health center.5,6 In 103 of these counties, Planned Parenthood sites served all of these clients. Nearly one-third of all women in need of publicly funded contraceptive services lived in the 332 counties where Planned Parenthood served all or most safety-net family planning clients.</p> 
<p>A 2016 survey of clients at Title X–funded health centers reinforces the importance of Planned Parenthood to the women it serves. Twenty-six percent of clients at a Planned Parenthood site reported that it was the only place they could get the services they need.</p></blockquote> 
<p>If federal funding to Planned Parenthood were to be cut off, community health centers would do all they could to try and fill the gap, but would fall far short. FQHC expert Sara Rosenbaum (disclosure: a colleague at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health) explains in <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/01/27/can-community-health-centers-fill-the-health-care-void-left-by-defunding-planned-parenthood/">a Health Affairs blog post</a> that “to assume that health centers are in a position to fill the void left by barring a health care provider of Planned Parenthood’s importance to Medicaid beneficiaries—even providers as attuned to the needs of their communities and accessible as community health centers—is simply wrong.”</p> 
<p>Texas officials claimed community health centers could fill the gap when they made Planned Parenthood ineligible to receive money from the state-funded program for reproductive-health services to low-income residents (a replacement for the federally funded program that didn’t let them discriminate against specific providers). However, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2016/02/08/womens-contraception-access-suffered-after-texas-excluded-planned-parenthood/">researchers found</a> some changes to contradict that claim in the counties served by Planned Parenthood affiliates that became ineligible for funding: In those counties, the program paid for fewer women to get some of the most effective forms of contraception, and Medicaid-covered births rose among women who’d previously received injectible contraceptives (which must be administered every three months). In estimating the impact of the AHCA, the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf">Congressional Budget Office</a> calculated that reduced access to contraception would result in thousands more births being covered by Medicaid, at a cost of $77 million over 10 years.</p> 
<p>On the positive side, states with more Planned Parenthood clinics per capita have lower rates of teen births and STI diagnoses, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/27/states-with-more-planned-parenthood-clinics-have-fewer-teen-births-and-sexually-transmitted-diseases/?utm_term=.fa5891efbda5">Miranda Yeaver reports</a>. And whether or not voters are aware of the specific population-level benefits of Planned Parenthood, they recognize its importance: A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-aca-replacement-plans-womens-health/">75% support continuing Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid payments</a>.</p> 
<p>Medicaid isn’t the only source of Planned Parenthood funding that’s at risk in future legislation. Planned Parenthood health centers also receive funding through the Title X grant program, which funds health centers that provide sexual and reproductive health services to clients with low incomes. After several states enacted policies that would have restricted specific providers from receiving Title X funding, the <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2016/09/12/obama-administration-hits-back-gops-attacks-family-planning/">Obama administration issued</a> a rule clarifying that states cannot exclude providers from the program based on factors unrelated to the quality of care they provide. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can vote to undo regulations finalized in the last six months of the previous presidency. With a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence in the Senate, <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2017/03/30/pences-vote-delivers-death-knell-family-planning-safeguards/">the 115<sup>th</sup> Congress voted to undo the Obama administration’s prohibition on state Title X programs discriminating against qualified providers</a>.</p> 
<p>This move from Congress means Title X funding to Planned Parenthood is in peril in states where elected officials are willing to cut off low-income women’s access to reproductive healthcare. Future Congressional actions could go farther and cut off all Title X funding entirely. House Republicans have previously tried to eliminate all funding for the Title X program from the federal budget. Eliminating the Title X program would reduce access to highly effective contraception, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screenings – overall, it would be <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2015/07/01/why-cut-a-cost-effective-program-that-helps-millions-of-women/">disastrous for public health</a>. I don’t understand why people who claim to be fiscal conservatives would cut a program that results in millions of dollars in Medicaid savings, or why those who call themselves “pro-life” would make a move that would result in many more abortions.</p> 
<p>I fear that we’ll keep seeing proposed legislation and regulations that would reduce women’s access to affordable health insurance, important health services, and essential healthcare providers. When these proposals come out, it’s worth asking whether the people behind them know or care enough about women’s health.</p>]]></description>

<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuXObDwltek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> 
<p>Their analysis found that there were 2654 cardiac arrests in public spaces. Based on their analyses, they found that 286 occurred with 100m of a Tim Horton’s coffee shop (a major Canadian coffee chain for my international readers). Starbucks was the top in downtown Toronto, with their locations covering 110 cardiac arrests. In fact, of the top 10 locations to place AEDs, 8 were occupied by coffee shops and bank branches.</p> 
<p>When minutes count, having people not have to search for an AED could potentially save lives. As the study author, Professor Timothy Chan, pointed out in this interview with <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/defibrillators-coffee-shops-abms-1.4033142">the CBC</a>:</p> 
<blockquote><p>“Most people probably don’t know where necessarily the closest AED is to them at any given point,” Chan said in an interview. “But you can probably have a rough idea where the closest Tim Horton’s is, or where your ATM is because you might frequent that ATM a lot.”</p> 
<p>Creating a mental link between AED and these places you’re familiar with is “so powerful in helping activate people to respond,” he said.</p></blockquote> 
<p>Knowing how this can potentially save lives, the study authors suggest that organizations may consider this in their space planning process. An AED can cost between <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/General/AED-Programs-Q-A_UCM_323111_Article.jsp#.WOFbUm_yuUk">$1500-$2000</a>, with an additional cost for training. While you may need a physician to help with the procurement process and act in a quality control capacity, this is a relatively small sum for a business to invest in a process that could potentially save customer lives, especially if they were to implement AEDs across all of their sites.</p> 
<p>In <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/03/02/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026318">another paper published two weeks prior</a>, the authors explored another option for delivering AEDs – drones. Titled “Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators,” this paper examined the size of the drone network needed to deliver AEDs faster than the historical 911 median response time. This found that a coordinated drone network could reduce times by between 6 and 10 minutes depending on whether the region was urban or rural. While one might think this technology is far into the future, drone technology is moving quickly and knowing the quantifiable benefits of such technology may even speed up adoption (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011">Amazon Air</a> as an example). The intersection of engineering, emergency medicine, geospatial analysis, and epidemiology makes this and the previous study a fascinating proposal that has very tangible benefits for public health.</p> 
<p>Next time you’re out, I encourage you to keep a look out for AED’s. They typically have signs up on the walls with the AED unit embedded in a small alcove, usually painted bright yellow or similar. Knowing where they are could save a life. Research like that discussed above though could take the guesswork out, and make it easier to find them if you are ever in a situation where one is needed.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Correction: This post originally mentioned a “heart attack” in the first paragraph, but should have referred to a “sudden cardiac arrest.” To quote the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/AboutHeartAttacks/Heart-Attack-or-Sudden-Cardiac-Arrest-How-Are-They-Different_UCM_440804_Article.jsp#.WOOw_mnyuJA">American Heart Association</a>: “<em>A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.</em>” Thanks to reader Kelsey for pointing that out!</p>]]></description>

<title>Chlorhexidine mouthrinse: Reduced plaque and gingivitis when used as adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img title="shutterstock_87714310" src="https://www.nationalelfservice.net/cms/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/shutterstock_87714310-150x150.jpg" alt="shutterstock_87714310-150x150.jpg"></p><p>51 studies were included in this Cochrane review of chlorhexidine mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene measures. The review provides high quality evidence for a large reduction in the build-up of plaque at 4 to 6 weeks or 6 months.  There is also  high quality evidence of a moderate reduction in gingivitis in patients with mild gingivitis which may not be clinically important.</p>
